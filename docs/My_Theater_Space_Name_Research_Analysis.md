## Round 2: Detailed Analysis

## 5. SHOWLOG

### Domain Availability

| Domain | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| showlog.com | ❓ Check needed | Likely parked or taken |
| showlog.app | ❓ Check needed | |
| showlog.netlify.app | ❌ TAKEN | Existing TV tracking web app |

### App Store Conflicts

**Google Play:**
- ❌ **"ShowLog"** — Existing app for timing acts in shows
  - Purpose: "Tool for anyone who needs to keep track of timing acts in a show. Whether you're a stage manager, technician or just a fan"
  - DIRECT CONFLICT — same name, same theater industry

**Web App:**
- ❌ **ShowLog** at showlog.netlify.app — TV/streaming show tracker
  - "Your personal streaming companion designed to help you track, organize, and stay on top of everything you've watched"
  - Similar concept to yours

### Related Competitors

- **Showly** — Major TV/movie tracking app (showlyapp.com)
  - Very similar name
  - Available on iOS and Android
  - Would cause confusion

### Trademark Concerns

- "ShowLog" and "Showly" too similar
- Existing app on Google Play with same name
- HIGH trademark risk due to direct naming conflict

### Verdict: ⛔ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Why:**
1. App called "ShowLog" already exists on Google Play
2. Web app at showlog.netlify.app already exists
3. Too similar to "Showly" (established TV tracker)
4. Name is basically taken across the board

## 6. MY THEATER / myTheater

### Domain Availability

| Domain | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| mytheater.com | ❓ Check needed | Likely taken |
| mytheater.app | ❓ Check needed | Possibly available |
| mytheaterapp.com | ❓ Check needed | Possibly available |

### App Store Conflicts

**iOS App Store:**
- ❌ **"myTHEATER"** — Developer account exists
  - Apps published by "myTHEATER" developer
  - DIRECT CONFLICT with the exact name

**Other conflicts:**
- "Broadway App" — Official Theater District app
- "Broadway.com" — Major Broadway ticketing/news app
- "Theatregoer - Theatre Tracker" — Existing theater tracking app
- "Mezzanine Theater Diary" — DIRECT competitor doing exactly what you want to build

### Key Competitor: Mezzanine

This is important — **Mezzanine** is essentially a theater Letterboxd:
- "A place to log your theater visits and review the shows you see"
- "Watch your theater history come to life with original poster art"
- "Follow your friends to see their latest theater trips"
- "View charts, maps and stats for all your theater visits"
- Covers 40 years of Broadway and West End history
- Has good reviews and active users

### Trademark Concerns

- "myTHEATER" developer already exists on App Store
- Generic phrase but with existing usage in app space
- MEDIUM risk

### Social Media

Would need variations like @mytheaterapp, @getmytheater

### Verdict: ⚠️ RISKY

**Why:**
1. "myTHEATER" developer already publishing apps
2. Mezzanine is an established competitor doing exactly this
3. Generic phrase = hard to trademark
4. Would need variant domains/handles

**Note:** You'd be competing directly with Mezzanine, which already has a user base and good reviews. This isn't necessarily bad — competition can work — but you need differentiation.

## 7. THEATER NERD / TheatreNerds

### Domain Availability

| Domain | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| theatrenerds.com | ❌ TAKEN | Established theater community website |
| theaternerd.com | ❓ Check needed | May be available |
| theaternerd.app | ❓ Check needed | Possibly available |
| theaternerds.com | ❓ Check needed | |

### Major Conflict: TheatreNerds.com

**theatrenerds.com** is an established website:
- "Community for live theatre nerds to unite, share stories, laughs, & resources"
- Active blog with articles, quizzes, Broadway news
- Has social following and content going back years
- Tagline: "We Are Thespians!"

This is a DIRECT branding conflict — they own the identity.

### App Store

- ✅ No app called "Theater Nerd" found
- BUT the brand identity is already established by theatrenerds.com

### Trademark Concerns

- theatrenerds.com has established prior use
- They could oppose your trademark
- HIGH risk of brand confusion
- They might even have common law trademark rights

### Social Media

- @theatrenerds likely taken (they're active)
- Would need variations

### Verdict: ⛔ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Why:**
1. **theatrenerds.com is an established brand** — they own this identity
2. Direct conflict with existing community
3. Could face opposition/legal issues
4. Even if technically available, you'd be building on someone else's brand equity

## Updated Recommendations

### Best Options (in order)

1. **My Theater Space** (your original) — Check availability, may be clear
2. **Standing O / StandingO** — No major conflicts found

- **Row** patterns: RowOne, FrontRow, OrchestraRow
- **Ticket** patterns: TicketLog, TicketTrack

Or go with your original: **My Theater Space** — simple, clear, memorable

## 1. CURTAIN CALL

### Domain Availability

| Domain | Status | Notes |

| curtaincall.app | ❓ Check needed | Likely available |
| curtaincall.io | ❓ Check needed | Likely available |
| curtaincallapp.com | ❓ Check needed | Possible alternative |

**Note:** The .com is taken but appears underutilized. Other domains in use:

- curtaincallbway.com — Theater fan blog
- curtaincallpa.com — Acting school
- curtaincallbraintree.org — Theater company

### App Store Conflicts

**iOS App Store:**
- ❌ **"Curtains Call"** — Existing theater app by San Jose Children's Musical Theater
  - Purpose: Communications app for theater productions (cast, crew, families)
  - Different use case but SAME AUDIENCE (theater community)
  - Could cause confusion

**Google Play:**
- ❌ **"Curtains Call"** — Same app as iOS
- ❌ **"커튼콜 (CurtainCall)"** — Korean app for tracking performances and reviews
  - This is VERY similar to your concept (performance tracking, reviews)
  - International but still a conflict

### Trademark Concerns

- "Curtain Call" is a common theatrical term (generic)
- Multiple businesses use the name (theaters, acting schools, dance studios)
- **"CURTAIN CALL CONNECTIONS"** trademark registered for dance/acting classes
- Generic term = harder to trademark exclusively
- LOW exclusive trademark risk, but HIGH confusion risk due to multiple users

| Platform | Handle | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Twitter/X | @curtaincall | ❌ Likely taken |
| Instagram | @curtaincall | ❌ Likely taken |
| TikTok | @curtaincall | ❓ Unknown |

Would need variations like @curtaincallapp, @getcurtaincall, etc.

### Verdict: ⛔ NOT RECOMMENDED

**Why:**
1. Existing app "Curtains Call" targets same theater audience

3. .com domain taken
4. Too many existing businesses with this name
5. Generic term = hard to stand out in search

- **Showlog** — simple, clear
- **CurtainUp** — theatrical, energetic
- **Bravo** — short, theatrical (check availability)
- **Encore** — implies returning (check availability)
